# Kickstarter Campaigns Analysis

## OVERVIEW OF FEVER CROWDFUNDING
This project is to provide the necessary information to Louise who is looking to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play, "Fever." This information seeks to alleviate some of Louiseâ€™s hesitancy by providing some knowledge on whether there are specific factors that make a crowdfunding campaign successful, and set her campaign to mirror other successful campaigns in the same category.
