# Kickstarter Campaigns Analysis


### OVERVIEW OF FEVER CROWDFUNDING
This project is to provide the necessary information to Louise who is looking to start a crowdfunding campaign to fund her play, "Fever." This information seeks to alleviate some of Louise’s hesitancy by providing some knowledge on whether there are specific factors that make a crowdfunding campaign successful, and set her campaign to mirror other successful campaigns in the same category.


### ANALYSIS
I created a linear chart to predict the successful, failed, and canceled theater outcomes by launch date using theater as a categorial predictor.

Based on the above chart, we can deduce theaters most successfully launched in May and June. A launch date in the month of October has the highest failure rate. December launch dates have a near equal probability of being successful vs failed. January had the highest canceled theater launch dates while July had the least. 
According to the data, it is recommended to have a theater launch date either in May or June

I created a second linear chart to predict the outcomes based on goals. Again, I used theater as a categorical predictor.

Based on the above chart, the lowest goal at less than 1000 has the highest likelihood of success and the lowest likelihood of failure. In contrast the highest goal at 50000 or more doesn’t have the lowest likelihood of success and the highest likelihood of failure. The goal range of 45000 to 49999 has the lowest likelihood of success and the highest likelihood of failure. 
In summary, a goal of 24999 or less has a higher success rate of about 71% while 25000 or more has a success rate of about 32%. A goal of 24999 or less has a lower failure rate of about 49% while 25000 or more has a higher failure rate of about 68%


### CHALLENGES AND LIMITATIONS
The Launch date in December have very close successful and failed outcomes. This poses as a challenge as it proves difficult recommend or rule out December. 
There was no correlation between the goal ranges and the success or failure outcomes. There appeared to be a negative correlation until the 30000 to 35000 range.
